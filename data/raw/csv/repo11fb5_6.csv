With this commit we make a further step anddetect one more error case.

Then we cansend GOAWAY.The previous code shrinks closed streams when we closed anotherstream but now it is removed.  It is enough to adjust closed streamswhen new incoming stream is created.While creating this commit we noticed thatNGHTTP2_INITIAL_MAX_CONCURRENT_STREAMS is defined as INT32_MAX.  Butsince SETTINGS can contain value up to UINT32_MAX it is not enough.However since the stream ID space is limited to INT32_MAX it is highenough.  We could keep this value but this time we deprecateNGHTTP2_INITIAL_MAX_CONCURRENT_STREAMS macro.

The window size is 64KiB which is abit small and cannot utilize full server performance when responsesize is not too small.  Basically we do this kind of benchmarkingtest to measure servers throughput and optimal performance.  Smallerwindow certainly degrades performance even in local testing becauseserver is so fast that it has to wait for WINDOW_UPDATE from h2load.To make default behaviour suitable for peak performance test wedecided to disable flow control in h2load by setting large enoughwindow size.Most users used h2load without -w or -W options so they wereimplicitly throttled by flow control and the result was affected bythat negatively.  Now flow control is disabled by default the resultmay improve depending on the implementations.",0,0,1,"Tatsuhiro Tsujikawa",tatsuhiro-t,404610,tatsuhiro.t@gmail.com,"2015-04-27 12:23:01","Tatsuhiro Tsujikawa",tatsuhiro-t,404610,tatsuhiro.t@gmail.com,"2015-04-27 12:23:01","42b2430fe17b94845cd430a2713365e20740add2 ",6,11,b41835f19b5c2099e4579f1dec5ecc2feb3f1e76,12,2,h2r

This isbecause buffered data inside SSL is not notified by io watcher.  It isobvious but we totally missed it.nghttpx code normally reads everything until SSL_read returns error(want-read).  But if rate limit is involved we stop reading early.Also in HTTP/1 code while processing one request we just read untilbuffer is filled up.
