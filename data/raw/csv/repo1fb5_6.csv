Idle timeout for inactivity when there are no streams in processing    (the http2_idle_timeout directive); 2. Receive timeout for incomplete frames when there are no streams in    processing (the http2_recv_timeout directive); 3. Send timeout when there are frames waiting in the output queue    (the send_timeout directive on a server level).Reaching one of these timeouts leads to HTTP/2 connection close.This left a number of scenarios when a connection can get stuck without anyprocessing and timeouts: 1. A client has sent the headers block partially so nginx starts processing    a new stream but cannot continue without the rest of HEADERS and/or    CONTINUATION frames; 2. When nginx waits for the request body; 3. All streams are stuck on exhausted connection or stream windows.The first idea that was rejected was to detect when the whole connectiongets stuck because of these situations and set the global receive timeout.The disadvantage of such approach would be inconsistent behaviour in sometypical use cases.  For example if a user never replies to the browsersquestion about where to save the downloaded file the stream will beeventually closed by a timeout.  On the other hand this will not happenif theres some activity in other concurrent streams.Now almost all the request timeouts work like in HTTP/1.x connections sothe client_header_timeout client_body_timeout and send_timeout arerespected.  These timeouts close the request.The global timeouts work as before.Previously the c->write->delayed flag was abused to avoid setting timeouts onstream events.

Then this queue was processed inngx_http_v2_write_handler().If accept_mutex is enabled the events ready flag is set but itshandler is not called immediately.  Instead the event is added tothe ngx_posted_events queue.  At the same time in this queue can beevents from upstream connections.  Such events can result in sendingoutput queue before ngx_http_v2_write_handler() is triggered.  Andat the time ngx_http_v2_write_handler() is called the output queuecan be already empty with some streams added to h2c->posted.But after 82efcedb310b these streams werent processed if all frameshave already been sent and the output queue was empty.  This might leadto a situation when a number of streams were get stuck in h2c->postedqueue for a long time.  Eventually these streams might get closed bythe send timeout.In the worst case this might also lead to a segmentation fault ifalready freed stream was left in the h2c->posted queue.

838,1,5429140c018726e8b28c724b06daaf0fe33d2205,"HTTP/2: implemented preread buffer for request body (closes #959).Previously the streams window was kept zero in order to prevent a clientfrom sending the request body before it was requested (see 887cca40ba6a fordetails).  Until such initial window was acknowledged all requests withdata were rejected (see 0aa07850922f for details).That approach revealed a number of problems: 1. Some clients (notably MS IE/Edge Safari iOS applications) show an error    or even crash if a stream is rejected; 2. This requires at least one RTT for every request with body before the    client receives window update and able to send data.To overcome these problems the new directive http2_body_preread_size isintroduced.  It sets the initial window and configures a special per streampreread buffer that is used to save all incoming data before the body isrequested and processed.If the directives value is lower than the default initial window (65535)as previously all streams with data will be rejected until the new windowis acknowledged.  Otherwise no special processing is used and all requestswith data are welcome right from the connection start.The default value is chosen to be 64k which is bigger than the defaultinitial window.
